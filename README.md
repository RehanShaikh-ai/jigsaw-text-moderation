## Overview

Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification leverages the [Jigsaw dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) to build and benchmark text moderation systems.  
The aim is to compare traditional machine learning models with modern deep learning and explore explainable AI (XAI) for trustworthy moderation.
